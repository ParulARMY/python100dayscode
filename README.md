#### Exercise 01: Printing to the console
#### Exercise 02: Debugging
#### Exercise 03: Inputs
#### Exercise 04: variables
#### Project 01:[Band Name Generator] : A band name generator from the inputs of users of their country and a random pet name.

#### Project 02:[Tip Calulator] : Created a simple calculator that takes input of the total bill, percentage of the amount of people to split the bill.
1. Applied the `f` string.(found it really convenient)
2. Reminded me that inputs are in string data type and has to be converted into float/integers before doing any calculations.
3. Reminded me how to round off with a specified decimal number `rounding_off = Round(2.666666,2)`=`2.66`

<b>Day 3</b>:[`Direct Link`](https://github.com/ParulARMY/python100dayscode/tree/main/Day-3)<br>

<b>Day 4</b>:[`Direct Link`]<br>
#### Exercise 01:[Random Number]
#### Exercise 02:[Heads & Tails]
#### Exercise 03:[Banker Roulette]
#### Exercise 04:[Treasure map]
#### Project 04:[Rock, paper,scissors] :Created a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the computer's move is randomly generated using the random.choice after putting all moves into a list and selecting randomly.

1.Overall ,learned about lists and how flexible it is whether it is to extend the list, replacing the items,choose a specific item with index starting from 0 and -1, extending the list with another list from input and more.

2.Learned that nested list and list_name[1][1] means choosing the second nested list in the general list and then choosing the second item from the selected list.

3.Revised if/elif/else statements and nested ifs.

4.Learned about the python random module and differentiating between `random.randint(starting index, ending index)`/`random.float()`/`random.choice(list_name)`.

5.Aware of index error and in most situation the index has to -1 since the computer starts counting from 0.
